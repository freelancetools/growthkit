00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.193
Okay, so what we're going to do is just kind of go over some questions as a breakdown for the brand.

00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:06.393
I'm recording now.

00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:13.298
And let me close this up.

00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:16.167
All right, so what does the brand do in your words?

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:20.727
It's a filter showerhead company.

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:25.176
I guess protecting people from hard water.

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:34.859
Okay, so on a day-to-day basis, what do they have you doing for the brand?

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:38.379
Managing our paid media channels.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.380
Mainly Meta, and some other programmatic platforms.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.762
But pretty much like head of paid media and potentially head of growth if I take on that role.

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:50.082
Nice.

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:56.684
What was the last task that your higher-ups asked you to do?

00:00:56.704 --> 01:01.845
Most recently, just scale the ad account, get back to our revenue goals.

01:02.806 --> 01:04.326
So I had to push pretty aggressively.

01:05.426 --> 01:10.088
Prior to that, it was getting another channel live and managing that.

01:10.108 --> 01:15.009
And then also providing feedback on some of the new landing pages that we've created and working with our advertorial specialists.

01:15.009 --> 01:23.054
I guess, on building out more assets for us to run ads to.

01:24.515 --> 01:31.801
And on a day-to-day basis, it seems like you get to touch the ads more often here than like some of your other projects.

01:32.021 --> 01:32.301
Yeah.

01:34.022 --> 01:48.107
Got a lot more free will with how I want to manage the account, how much I want to spend, of course, letting them know what I'm looking to achieve and accomplish, and then letting me know if it's possible based off of logistics and how much product we have.

01:48.167 --> 01:55.530
So yeah, pretty much have, like I said, free will to steer this thing however I want it to go as long as we're hitting our KPIs.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.010
Okay.

01:58.030 --> 02:02.032
For the onboarding, how long ago were you onboarded?

02:03.604 --> 02:16.388
I've been with them since the beginning, but didn't take over managing ads until like, it's probably been like a year, maybe last September, honestly, last October in that range is when I took over.

02:16.568 --> 02:16.829
Yeah.

02:17.329 --> 02:19.610
So has the team changed a lot since you onboarded?

02:19.630 --> 02:22.030
Like some of the people that you met in the beginning, are they still around as well?

02:22.070 --> 02:22.270
Yeah.

02:22.290 --> 02:25.312
For the most part, the core team is still there.

02:26.252 --> 02:27.092
That I met initially.

02:29.873 --> 02:31.794
Some VAs may have swapped out, but...

02:32.974 --> 02:34.876
And we added a CFO.

02:34.896 --> 02:38.338
He's been super helpful.

02:38.458 --> 02:42.080
His name's also Alex, but that's the only other major addition since then.

02:42.781 --> 02:43.281
Nice.

02:43.942 --> 02:49.986
And as far as the technical team goes, who do you work closely with on that side?

02:51.047 --> 02:57.351
As far as managing the ads, do you get access to a technical team, or is it pretty much you have to cover everything yourself?

02:57.891 --> 02:58.832
So I get access to a creative strategist, she has editors underneath her.

02:59.583 --> 03:00.204
But other than that, our founder usually handles the communication and getting that stuff built out.
