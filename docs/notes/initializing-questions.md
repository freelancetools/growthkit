## Rubric of Discovery & Interview Questions

### Category 1: Establishing Context (The "What")
*Purpose: To get a high-level understanding of the business and the interviewee's role from their perspective.*

- **"What does [Company Name] do in your words?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* It's an open-ended question that reveals how the person sees the company's core mission, rather than just reciting a marketing line.

- **"On a day-to-day basis, what do they have you doing for the brand?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Moves from the general to the specific, focusing on actual, daily responsibilities and tasks.

- **"What was the last task that your higher-ups asked you to do?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* This is a brilliant tactical question. It cuts through generic job descriptions to reveal the most immediate, top-of-mind priority and pressure point.

### Category 2: Exploring Team Dynamics & Structure (The "Who")
*Purpose: To understand the ecosystem of people, dependencies, and reporting structures the person operates within. This is crucial for understanding collaboration challenges.*

- **"How long ago were you onboarded to [Company Name]?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Establishes tenure and provides context for their historical knowledge of the team.

- **"Has the team changed a lot since you onboarded? Like some of the people that you met in the beginning, are they still around as well?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Uncovers team stability, turnover, and potential changes in company culture or process.

- **"Who do you work closely with on the technical/creative side?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Maps out key collaborators and departments, identifying critical points of interaction.

- **"Do you get access to a technical team, or is it pretty much you have to cover everything yourself?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Clarifies the level of support and resources available, highlighting potential bottlenecks or areas where they are self-sufficient.

- **"So who's that person?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* A simple, direct follow-up to identify a specific, key individual mentioned in a process (in this case, the person whose creative performance drives the bonus pool).

- **"So are you downstream of [Person A] or [Person B]?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Seeks to precisely define a relationship or dependency within a workflow or incentive structure.

### Category 3: Uncovering Pains, Goals, and Aspirations (The "Why")
*Purpose: To get to the core of the problem. What is the person trying to achieve, what's stopping them, and what does success look like to them?*

- **"What are you trying to automate when dealing with [Project/Brand]?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Directly asks about pain points that can be solved with technology, focusing on efficiency and removing manual work.

- **"What actually matters to the team in terms of deliverables, and then what matters to you?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* This is a master-level question. It brilliantly separates stated team goals from personal motivations and priorities, which can often be different and more revealing.

- **"What are the best examples you've seen of [a desired outcome or behavior]? ... What are the best examples of that you could think of?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Instead of asking what they want, it asks them to describe what "good" looks like. This grounds the conversation in real-world examples and helps define a clear target state.

### Category 4: Digging into Motivation & Incentives (The "Real Why")
*Purpose: To understand the deepest drivers of behavior. Often, this is tied to compensation, recognition, or career advancement.*

- **"What incentives have they given you in terms of pay structure?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* A direct question that gets to the heart of financial motivation. It's often the single most important factor driving a person's focus.

- **"Like what incentives are they giving you for earning more money?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* A more direct, casual rephrasing of the above. This directness led to the most critical insight of the entire conversation: the bonus pool structure.

### Category 5: "Magic Wand" / Solution Ideation Questions
*Purpose: To get the interviewee to imagine the ideal solution and co-create the vision for the tool or project.*

- **"Is there anything that we could do with this [tool/repo] to help fill those gaps or reach those goals?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* Explicitly links the uncovered problems and incentives to the proposed solution, asking them to validate the connection.

- **"If you had everything you wanted from [Company] in this repo... what are some of the questions you would be asking it?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* The classic "Magic Wand" question. It frees the person from thinking about current limitations and encourages them to describe their ideal outcome, which is a goldmine for feature requirements.

### Category 6: Clarifying & Closing Questions
*Purpose: To ensure mutual understanding and provide a final opportunity for the interviewee to add anything that was missed.*

- **"Is that what you're talking about?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* A simple check-in to confirm understanding before moving on, preventing misinterpretation.

- **"Unless there's something else you think you want to cover off the top of your head?"**
    - *Why it's effective:* A polite and open-ended closing that gives the interviewee control and ensures no important topics were overlooked.
