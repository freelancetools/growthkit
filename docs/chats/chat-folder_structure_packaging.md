## ðŸ‘¤ Prompt

I'm new to Python packaging and feel a little unsure in the hierarchy of the folders here in this repo. I think the .py files in @scripts/ would actually fit better in a folder named "entrypoints" in @growthkit/ - what do you think?

## ðŸ¤– Response

I'll take a quick look at your `pyproject.toml` and the current `scripts/*.py` and any existing CLI utilities under `src/growthkit` to recommend the best structure and whether to move them under the package with proper console entry points.

Iâ€™m going to quickly scan the Slack and Gmail connector modules to confirm the callable entry points referenced in `pyproject.toml` exist and are import-safe, then Iâ€™ll recommend the cleanest structure for scripts vs in-package CLI.

I scanned your packaging config and the current wrappers. You already expose proper console entry points via `pyproject.toml`, and the thin `scripts/*.py` wrappers just delegate into the package.

- What you have now is the recommended layout:
  - **In-package code** lives under `src/growthkit/**` and is import-safe.
  - **Installed CLIs** are defined in `[project.scripts]` and point at package callables.
  - **Local convenience wrappers** live in `scripts/` for repo users who run via `python scripts/...`.

Relevant bits:
```python
[project.scripts]
gk-slack = "growthkit.connectors.slack.slack_fetcher:run_main"
gk-email = "growthkit.connectors.mail.gmail_sync:main"
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
```

```python
def run_main():
    """Run the async main function."""
    # Ensure workspace config exists and populate runtime settings
    try:
        load_workspace_settings()
    except RuntimeError as exc:
        ...
    ensure_chromium_installed()
    asyncio.run(main())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_main()
```

```python
def main():
    """Synchronises Gmail messages to local markdown exports."""
    ...
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Recommendation
- Keep `scripts/` where it is. Donâ€™t move these Python wrappers into `src/growthkit/entrypoints/`. Putting them inside the package would:
  - Ship them to end users unnecessarily
  - Encourage import-time side effects
  - Duplicate what `[project.scripts]` already provides

Optional tidy-ups
- You can rely solely on the installed CLIs and remove the two Python wrappers if you want fewer ways to do the same thing:
  - Use `gk-email` and `gk-slack` after `pip install -e .`
  - Keep `scripts/untrack_sensitive_files.sh` in `scripts/` (itâ€™s repo-scoped and should not be packaged)
- If you prefer a single multi-command CLI, add a small `growthkit/cli` with a `main()` that dispatches subcommands, then point one entry point (e.g., `gk = growthkit.cli:main`) at it. This is stylistic; your current two commands are fine.

Status update
- Reviewed `pyproject.toml`, the two wrappers in `scripts/`, and the Slack/Gmail callables they target. Verified entry points exist and are import-safe. No code changes made.

- Current structure is good:
  - `src/growthkit/**` for all logic
  - `[project.scripts]` for installed commands (`gk-email`, `gk-slack`)
  - `scripts/` stays as thin, repo-local wrappers and shell utilities
